    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white bread, sliced
        cheese, and butter. It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste 
        preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices white bread</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of 
            a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice
            of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side
            up on top of cheese.</li>
        <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until
            cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice
            of cheese.</li>
    </ol>
