            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is one of the more famous sandwiches straight out of the island of Cuba. 
                This recipe came from my uncle who used to work at a restaurant in Pinar del Rio, 
                Cuba and now works at a Cuban cafeteria here in Miami. This sandwich is best 
                served with fried plantain chips and a cold mamey milkshake!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 sweet bread rolls</li>
                <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
                <li>¼ cup prepared mustard</li>
                <li>1 pound thinly sliced cooked ham </li>
                <li>1 pound thinly sliced fully cooked pork</li>
                <li>1 pound sliced Swiss cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup dill pickle slices</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Split the sandwich rolls in half, and spread mustard and mayonnaise 
                    liberally onto the cut sides.</li>
                <li>On each sandwich, place and equal amount of Swiss cheese, ham and pork in exactly 
                    that order. Place a few pickles onto each one, and put the top of the roll 
                    onto the sandwich. Brush the tops with melted butter.</li>
                <li>Press each sandwich in a sandwich press heated to medium-high heat. 
                    If a sandwich press is not available, use a large skillet over medium-high heat, 
                    and press the sandwiches down using a sturdy plate or skillet. Some indoor grills 
                    may be good for this also. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, keeping sandwiches pressed. 
                    If using a skillet, you may want to flip them once for even browning.</li>
                <li>Slice diagonally and serve hot.</li>
